# CLAUDIO 

*CLAUDIO*, the tool for "**C**ross-**l**inking **a**nalysis **u**sing **di**stances and **o**verlaps", allows
for an in-depth evaluation of structure and sequence information, automating many necessary post-experiment analysis. 
It downloads protein structures for this, and returns protein-link-specific small-datasets containing structural 
restraints in CSV-format, and the input dataset extended by its results.
These include...
* ... PDB IDs of protein structures searched by BLASTP
* ... Mapping of UniProt protein to structure sequence positions
* ... Structural distances calculated with TopoLink
* ... Information on Homo-signal responses (e.g. overlapping peptide sequences in same-protein cross-links)
* ... Information on possible oligomeric states discovered by SWISS-MODEL homology
* ... Cross-link type estimations

## Prerequisites
### Python
This tool is written in and has to be run with python 3 (last tested v3.11).\
It has the following requirements:

Packages:
* biopython 1.79
* click 8.1.3
* matplotlib 3.6.3
* pandas 1.5.3
* requests 2.28.2

The packages may be installed all at once with the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/requirements.txt):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or individually:
```
pip install biopython==1.79
pip install click==8.1.3
pip install matplotlib==3.6.3
pip install pandas==1.5.3
pip install requests==2.28.2
```
Note: Both approaches need to refer to the pip-installer associated to the python installation, that will be used to run
the tool.

### External Tools
In order to run *CLAUDIO* you need to install the following external tools:
* **Topolink**[[1]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references) (for structural analysis)
* **BLASTP**[[2]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references) (for finding suitable protein structures)

#### Installation Instructions
* **Blast** with *pdbaa* database (see [Windows or Unix Manuals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52638/), or see this [MacOS Manual](https://www.blaststation.com/intl/members/en/howtoblastmac.html))
  * For Blast, you also have to download the newest *pdbaa* database. You may do so by navigating into your 
  Blast installation directory and running the following command:
    ```
    perl bin/update_blastdb.pl --passive --decompress pdbaa
    ```
    This download method requires `perl` to be executable from your commandline, which is not installed by 
  default on Windows and MacOS systems. You may install it with this 
  [Windows-Manual](https://learn.perl.org/installing/windows.html) or 
  [MacOS-Manual](https://learn.perl.org/installing/osx.html), or manually download the database 
  [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/).
  * Hint: If you followed the Installation Manual (linked up top) to-the-letter, you may have added the environmental 
    variable `$BLASTDB` to your paths. If so, you can use this variable instead of the full path in the input parameters
    of CLAUDIO.
* **TopoLink** (see [Installation Manual](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/topolink/download.shtml))
  * Topolink possesses a standalone executable for Windows 10 systems (or higher), which can be downloaded directly
  [here](http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/topolink/Windows_Binaries/Windows10-64bits/topolink.exe).

To ease the execution of *CLAUDIO* you may want to ensure that these tools can be executed directly from your terminal 
(e.g. add their respective `bin` directories to the `Path` variable of your OS). Otherwise, you may specify the
location of the `bin` directories in the input parameters.

### Online connection
*CLAUDIO* calls upon the API of a number of bioinformatic online databases ([UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
[[3]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references), [RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/)
[[4]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references), [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
[[5]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references), and [SWISS-MODEL](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)
[[6]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references)) during its computations. This means it cannot be 
run offline.\
It is furthermore recommended having a stable internet connection, as otherwise certain API calls may not be answered or
lead to empty results. This of course, also necessitates the database server's side to be running properly as well. If 
errors or suspicious inconsistencies in the results persist due to this, you may want to try again later.

### Offline Databases
In addition to the aforementioned online databases, *CLAUDIO* accesses the SIFTS database
[[7,8]](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main#references). The file in question can be found 
[here](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/claudio/data/pdb_chain_uniprot.csv).\
We also recommend updating this file from time to time ([download here](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/msd/sifts/flatfiles/csv/pdb_chain_uniprot.csv.gz)) 
in order to keep up its efficiency, though this is not a necessity (last updated: 26.09.2023).

## Usage
*CLAUDIO* consists of a total of 4 modules. Each module can be run independently as long as appropriate inputs are 
delivered. For details on how to run the modules individually see their respective README-files.
* [Module 01 - Unique protein (pair) listing tool](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/claudio/module01/README.md)
* [Module 02 - Structural distance analysis tool](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/claudio/module02/README.md)
* [Module 03 - Overlapping peptide sequence analysis tool](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/claudio/module03/README.md)
* [Module 04 - XL-type evaluation](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/claudio/module04/README.md)

```
### Input
This tool requires a CSV-file containing multiple observed cross-linking interactions. Two columns have to contain 
uniprot ids for each interacting residue, two columns have the observed peptides for each interacting residue
and two columns the crosslinked residue's position within the full sequence (alternative: fill these 
with Nans, but add two columns with the residue's positions in the respective peptides).
1. The input file should then be specified as such with the "-i / --input-filepath"-parameter.
2. If you intend to run CLAUDIO on separate datasets simultaneously, or want to split your dataset into smaller ones,
you have to specify the parameter "-it / --input-temppath". CLAUDIO generates multiple temporary files during its
computation, most of which are in- or outputs of the third-party tools used. If parallel executions of CLAUDIO are run
with the same tempfile path, conflicts may be caused disrupting or falsifying some results. Thereby make sure to specify
different paths here, if you run the tool in parallel.
3. It is important to customize the parameter "-p / --projections". This parameter requires a comma separated list
as input, which maps the column names of your dataset to the ones used in the tool.
4. You need to specify the paths to the local external tool installations (BLASTP and TopoLink).
The parameters for this are "-bl / --blast-bin" for the binary directory of blast, "-bldb / --blast-db" for the database
directory containing the *pdbaa* database files, and "-tl / --topolink-bin" for the binary directory of TopoLink.
5. Make sure you customize the settings pertaining the cross-linking experiments specifications, e.g. 
"-x / --xl-residues" for the aminoacids which may be cross-linked, and both "-lmin / --linker-minimum" and 
"-lmax / --linker-maximum" for the cross-linker's range capability. Besides this specify the amino acids the used cross-
linker is able to bind to. For this specify a tiny comma-separated list of possibly crosslinked residues, as 
one-letter-code symbols. Optionally you may add two colon-symbols, if they wish to specify the position of the 
residue in the sequence and/or the atom in the residue used for the distance computation. After the first colon-symbol 
they may place the atom type for the distance computation, e.g. 'CB', 'CA', or 'N', etc. . If no value is set here 'CB'
will be used by default. After the second colon-symbol they may place one of three position values: 0 if the residue
may occur anywhere in the protein, 1 if the residue has to be at the N-terminus, or -1 if the residue has to be at the
C-terminus (ex.: use "K:CB:0" to calculate the cross-link distance between lysin C-beta-atoms at any position in the
chain). If you want to specify multiple possible positions for the same symbol you have to add them
individually (ex.: "M::1,M::-1" for methionine at either the beginning or end of the chain). By default, 0 is set here,
e.g. the residue may be placed anywhere.\
Note: If the position or the atom type is specified there have to be two colon-symbols (ex.: "K,M:1" will not be
accepted as input). You can leave the respective specification empty though, if you wish to use the default here (ex.:
"K::1" is equal to "K:CB:1", "M:N:0" is equal to "M:N:", "K:CB:0" is equal to "K::" and also to just "K").

With this the relevant settings are defined. You may choose to further specify the structure searche's settings in terms
of coverage, sequence identity, and e-value, as well as the resolution cutoff during the structure selection, or even 
the advanced settings.

You may see examples for all parameters in the [example configuration-file](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/blob/main/config/config.txt),
which also serves as an alternative to supply all parameter inputs.


### Output
This tool returns all the outputs listed in the modules (see 
[module01](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/claudio/module01),
[module02](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/claudio/module02),
[module03](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/claudio/module03),
[module04](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/claudio/module04)).

Note: All CSV-file outputs pertaining the input dataset are summarized into a single one (marked with 
'_final.csv'-extension), e.g. the output CSV-file of module01 ending with '.sqcs', of module02 ending with 
'.sqcs_structdi.csv', and of module03 ending with '.sqcs_ops.csv' will be summarized here. 

### Example
**CLAUDIO** (in full) can be run like this:
* with a configuration file with all parameters (this will run the test dataset, when using the default config.txt, with all non-described parameters being filled with default values)
```
python3 claudio/claudio.py -c config/config.txt
```
* with a configuration file and a few overwriting CLI parameters (this will run the larger benchmark dataset)
```
python3 claudio/claudio.py -c config/config.txt -i benchmark_data.csv -o test/out/benchmark
```
* with mostly default parameters and a few set as CLI parameters
```
python3 claudio/claudio.py -i /home/user/me/docs/xl_dataset.csv -o /home/user/me/docs/claudio_outputs
```
\
Also, you may return all CLI parameter options on the terminal like this:
```
python claudio/claudio.py --help
```
